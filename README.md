### Telangana Tourism Data Analysis Project Overview

**Objective:**
The Telangana Tourism Data Analysis project aims to derive strategic insights from four years of comprehensive data (2016-2019) on domestic and foreign tourist visitation. The project provides a roadmap for informed decision-making to bolster the tourism sector in Telangana.

### Methodology

### Step 1: Data Compilation
- Eight separate Excel files detailing domestic and foreign visitors from 2016 to 2019 were consolidated.
  
### Step 2: Data Integration
- Merged the eight files using Microsoft Excel Power Query, creating a unified dataset. The data includes district-wise and month-wise information.

### Step 3: Visual 1 - Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of Tourists
- Utilized the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) formula:
  
  **`CAGR = [(Ending Value / Starting Value)^(1 / Number of Years)] ‚Äì 1`**
- Plotted the top and bottom 3 districts based on CAGR, showcasing trends in tourist increments or decrements.

### Step 4: Visual 2 - Projected Tourists from 2020-2025 for Hyderabad
- Calculated the average growth rate of domestic visitors from 2016 to 2019 for Hyderabad.
- Assumed a constant growth rate for 2022-2025 to project future domestic and foreign visitors.

### Step 5: Visual 3 - Projected Revenue in 2025 for Hyderabad
- Calculated total projected revenue for 2025, considering average revenue figures for domestic and foreign visitors:
  - Domestic: Rs. 5600.00 /-
  - Foreign: Rs. 1200.00 /-

### Step 6: Visual 4 - Districts with Most Visitors
- Created separate Pivot tables for domestic, foreign, and overall visitors.
- Visualized the top districts in each category to identify tourism hotspots.

### Step 7: Visual 5 - Domestic to Foreign Tourists Ratio (D2F Ratio)
- Computed the D2F ratio as the average ratio of domestic to foreign visitors for each district.
- A higher ratio indicates untapped potential for improvement in the tourism sector.

### Step 8: Visual 6 & 7 - Top Visiting Months in Hyderabad
- Constructed a pivot table with districts as rows and months as columns to highlight the visiting trends in Hyderabad.
- Presented the trends through a line chart for effective visualization.

### Step 9: Visual 7 - Tourists to Population Ratio
- Calculated the projected population for 2019 using the formula:

  **`Projected Population = Base Population √ó (1 + Growth Rate)^(Number of Years)`**
- Integrated projected populations into the main dataset and computed the tourist to population ratio.

### Step 10: Visual 8 - Crime Ratio for 2022
- Extracted crime rates for 2022 from Telangana DGP (source: [Telangana DGP](https://www.aninews.in/news/national/general-news/crime-rate-increased-by-444-pc-in-state-compared-to-last-year-telangana-dgp20221229232153/)).
- Plotted the changes in percentages for various crime categories.

### Step 11: Visual 9 - Cleanliness Ratings till 2023
- Retrieved Delta Achievement Scores (cleanliness ratings) from [credible sources](https://sbm.gov.in/SSG2023/ODFPLusRankingDeltaScore.aspx).
- Visualized the top districts with the highest delta scores.

This structured methodology ensures a comprehensive and actionable analysis of Telangana's tourism landscape. Each step contributes valuable insights for stakeholders and decision-makers in the tourism sector.
